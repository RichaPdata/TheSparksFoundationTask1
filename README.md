Hello everyone,
This is my first task as a Data Science & Business Analytics Intern with The Sparks FoundationÂ under 
hashtag
#GRIPNOVEMBER23  batch.
The objective of this task is: Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning.
We have to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours.
For this task we'll be using Simple Linear Regression Algorithm since the data involves just 2 variables.
Linear Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm based on supervised learning; it performs a regression task.
Workflow behind implementation of Linear Regression Algorithm:
1. Import, read and understand the data.
2. Visualize the data.
3. Train the model. Fit the data into Linear Regression Model.
4. Test the data and modify if required.
5. Your model is ready to predict.
